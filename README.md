# nbadraft_visualization
+ This project uses a NBA API and wrangles the data. With the wrangled data, it uses googleVis package to create interaction data visualizations for the 2017 NBA draft.
+ Unfortunately, the project couldn't be exported as a github_document file, so you won't be able to view the full project with all the visualizations. In hopes to resolve this issue, I also put the html file which one should be able to download/copy the html code and see the full project on html.
